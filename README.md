# Ed's 'Secret' Project #

## Concept ##

This coding project is an attempt to create a base of code that is common to several game ideas I have to implement, the shared concept amongst them being that of a javascript browser game backed by Backwi.re to provide multiplayer.

## Game Ideas ##

Currently, there are a few different games I am keeping in mind while developing the codebase and algorithms:

- 'Monsterwire' : A 'stealth necromancer' game where you have to use your magic to terrorize and evade the medieval populace and their militias.
- 'Warband' : A squad-based game where you convince others to join your cadre to explore, rob dungeons, or raid villages.
- 'Europa Hyperstoralis' : A Europa Universalis III-like game for the browser
